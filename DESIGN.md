Answer1:
User usually usign substitutions—replacing to make their passwords more unhackable. Letters with similar-looking numbers or symbols like 'E' with '3' or 'A' with '4'—and appending or prepending common numbers or symbols such as '123', '!', or '@';  If we want to crack them, we can create mappings for leet equivalents and lists of common prefixes and suffixes, then generate password variations by applying these transformations to the original password.

Answer2:
In my program, I used memory less than the CPU. Because the working memory needed to execute the password cracker is relatively low when generating password variations on the fly—minimizing memory usage—and since the primary bottleneck is the time it takes to process and compare each password attempt, a password cracker is more limited by processing speed than by memory.
