1. I asked chatGPT about the error message I ran into in the terminal. I also give a part of my function for convert hash64 to hash32. 
2. I also asked it to understand the use of SHA256 because I can not fully understand what is written in README.md. Then I modify my check_password funciton using it's generated code.
